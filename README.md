# Assignment 7

This is a simulation of randomly shaped creatures. The creatures are made of a series of random parts which are connected by random joints. Each successive body part can connect to any other existing body part, which creates some interesting results. The creature can grow in any direction in 3D and has randomly placed sensors throughout the body which control its joints.
