# Assignment 6

This is a simulation of randomly long snake robots. The snakes consist of randomly sized parts connected one after the other. Parts may randomly have sensors, which are indicated by green body parts, or not, which are indicated by blue body parts. For now the snakes just move randomly and don't do anything particularly interesting.
